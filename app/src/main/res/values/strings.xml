    <string name="post">Hello, this is the new Netology! Once upon a time, Netology was read with online marketing intensives. Then there were courses on design, development, analytics and management. We grow ourselves and help students: from beginners to confident professionals. But the most important thing remains with us: we believe that everyone already has the power that makes you want more, aim higher, run faster. Our mission is to help get on the path of growth and start a chain of change â†’ http://netolo.gy/fyb</string>
